# California-Real-Estate-Analysis

ABSTRACT

In this project, my aim was to conduct research on the California Housing market and try to find
why some locations in California have such a drastic price difference than other locations. This
was done through exploring multiple variables such as income, square footage, crime rates, and education scores for each property.
By analyzing these variables, I found that income in the individual counties has an effect on the
pricing of properties. This was done through correlation tests as well using scatterplots to visualize my findings.
